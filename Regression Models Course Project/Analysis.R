# 1. Context --------------------------------------------------------------
# You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry.
# Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in 
# exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon 
# (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two 
# questions:
# 
# “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
# "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"


# 2. Requirements ---------------------------------------------------------

# Take the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question
# using regression models and exploratory data analyses.
#
# Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
# 
# Brief. 
# 
# Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text.
# 
# Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages 
# including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
# 
# Include a first paragraph executive summary.
