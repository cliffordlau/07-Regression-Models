# The P-value is small (less than 0.05). So, according to

# that was wrong... try something else
# Try this:
# The P-value is larger than 0.05. So, according to our criterion, 
# we would fail to reject, which suggests that the interaction terms
# may not be necessary.

# this is right

# Q7:
# It is possible for the coefficient to reverse sign after adjustment. 
# For example, it can be strongly significant and positive before adjustment 
# and strongly significant and negative after adjustment.
